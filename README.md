## Troubleshooting

### macOS Application Not Responding

If Gapless (G4Music) is not responding on macOS, you may need to set the GSK_RENDERER environment variable to use the OpenGL renderer. Follow these steps:

1. Set the Environment Variable: Open your terminal and add the following line:

```bash
# for g4music
export GSK_RENDERER="gl"
```

2. Rerun the Application: Start Gapless by running:

```bash
g4music
```

This should resolve issues related to the application not responding on macOS.
